PROJECT TITLE: Camera package
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Enable big worlds with a small part being displayed on the screen. Allows to automaticly follow an actor or be fixed to a certain location.
VERSION or DATE: 0.2.1 (24.3.20)
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Copy this folder into your scenario folder. If you want to use it in a class simply import "camera.*" like you import greenfoot, too.
AUTHORS: RcCookie
USER INSTRUCTIONS: To get to know the methods I highly recomend that you go through the documentation of the camera class by opening documentation/Camera.html.
IMPORTANT: Using camera works fine for collision detection between actors and key inputs, BUT NOT with mouse input. This might change at some point but for now you cannot
interact with the displayed stuff via right click or mouseInfo.
