/**
 * Representation of a generic geometrical vector. The common abstract implementation
 * if this class is {@link AbstractVector}.
 * <p>Different vectors can have different sizes, meaning the number of different
 * dimension. Inside of an instance of a vector the size must be constant though.
 * Usually vectors should have at least 2 dimensions, otherwise they don't make a
 * lot of sence. Because of that the methods {@link #x()} and {@link #y()} exist as
 * conveniance methods.
 * <p>At any point in time any dimension of a vector can be requsted using
 * {@link #getDim(int)}. If that dimension is negative, a {@link RuntimeException} of
 * some sort will be thrown. If the dimension is not provided by the vector, it will
 * return {@code 0}, as if it was placed in a world with that many dimensions.
 * <p>Vectors offer a lot of methods to mathmatically interact with them, like adding
 * or scaling them, or calculating its length. For more specific operations like cross
 * products or angles you need to use the dimension-specific implementations like
 * {@link Vector2D}.
 * <p>Any vector can also savely be converted into a 2D or 3D vector, for conveniance.
 * Note that if the vector is already of that format it will return itself (not a copy).
 * <p>A vector may be <i>immutable</i>. This means that while reading methods will work
 * like normal, any method that may change a coordinate of the vector will throw an
 * {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.
 * <p>Additionally, the vector class also contains some static methods to work with
 * vectos.
